The purpose of gitignore files is to ensure that certain files not tracked by Git remain untracked.

To stop tracking a file that is currently tracked, use git rm --cached.

Git does not follow symbolic links when accessing a .gitignore file in the working tree. This keeps behavior consistent when the file is accessed from the index or a tree versus from the filesystem.

TO IGNORE FILE FROM BEING PUSHED
use touch to create the file 
use vim to edit the file
use ESC + :wq to save and quit from vim 
the add commit and push to the origin
